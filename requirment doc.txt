Need more discussion:


-- display unavailable options of atleast 10 bikes and 2 available
	
Currently the scooty we are offering is just honda activa ,as it driven by both male and female and widely used.
If the customer base increases ,we will start to offer motorcycles like splendor/city which will give more mileage and ease of transportation.



-- petrol options and charges... options 
    1) free petrol 1 lt, 2lt
    2) Full tank - chargable

We have not thought on the petrol front yet.It wouldn't be free though.


-- Helmets:

We will provide helmet.That would give extra leverage to sale.
1 helmet would be free ,an extra helmet would cost 10 rupee/day.



-- bike description :
    1)Milage
    2)Model
    3)Minimum rent : 600/2Days

I have provided the charges in the attached excel sheet ,which is just for Activa.The charges are based on discount which increase as the number of days increase.
The maximum number of days for which a bike would be booked is 31 days.
All the scooty which we will buy ,will be of same year(2012) and same model with color white.


-- charges as per bike activa, pulsur - database change

The discount will be stored in database and the tariff will be calculated on run time depending on the number of days.


-- pagination on bike options + grid

Initially lets keep it simple.

we will provide a description .
The easiest mode of transport for anyone is a two wheeler which can be driven by almost everyone.
and then will write some good things about scootys and have a image of Honda Activa with its features in a detailed manner.

We will not have bike option ,just one scooty honda activa.

We can display 2 to 3 bikes ,available just honda activa.

-- Pick and drop ?

For now the pick up and drop would be the parking lot of my society.

-- booking extension option


Need to think on that.

Rather than extension ,i was thinking to start the booking process again.
